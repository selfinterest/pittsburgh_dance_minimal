                So what's going on here? We've isolated the scope so that this directive only has access to the data it needs to do its
                job. What is that data?
                (1) The username and password. These are contained within form controls already within the scope (they're in loginBox.html.)
                (2) A flag to watch, set when the login form is showing on the screen. Set by the service.
                (3) A submit action.
                (4) A flag that gets triggered when the login is invalid.
                The isolate scope works by reading the value of a DOM attribute.
                <login-box isVisible="login.showLogin" submit="login.perform" invalid="login.invalid"></login-box>

                So the value of scope.focusWhen is set to the value of login.showLogin on the parent scope (that is, NavCtrl.)
                The value of invalid is set to the value of login.showLogin on the parent scope.

                Think of this as a way of selectively giving the the directive access to controller data without giving it full access to the controller's data.
                This limits side-effects. The directive does not NEED to ALTER controller data. It just needs to USE controller data. An isolation scope
                PREVENTS any unintentional alteration of the controller's state.
